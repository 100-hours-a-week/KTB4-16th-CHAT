# MULO Chat Server Agent Instructions

This file defines mandatory operating rules for AI coding agents working in the `mulo-chat` repository.

The agent must follow these instructions before reading, creating, modifying, deleting, or refactoring project code.

---

## 1. Mandatory Reading and Rule Precedence

Before making any change:

1. Read `RULE.md`.
2. Treat `RULE.md` as mandatory team policy.
3. Read this `AGENTS.md` as the AI-specific operating policy.
4. Read any relevant project documentation before changing architecture, database schema, API contracts, security, or testing behavior.
5. Inspect the existing implementation before introducing a new pattern.

Rule precedence for repository work:

1. Explicit instruction from the developer for the current task
2. `RULE.md`
3. `AGENTS.md`
4. Existing project conventions
5. General framework conventions

If instructions conflict or are ambiguous, stop and ask the developer before changing code.

---

## 2. Project Identity

- Repository / Artifact: `mulo-chat`
- Service: MULO Chat Server
- Java package root: `com.ktb4.team16.mulo.chat`
- Database name: `mulo_chat`

Do not rename the project, root package, database, or major modules without explicit developer approval.

The files under `specs/` are copied from the MULO backend repository. If their Chat design conflicts with the current Chat Server requirements or Flyway migrations, report the conflict and do not treat the copied Chat sections as permission to change the Chat database schema.

---

## 3. Technology Baseline

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 4.1.x
- Gradle
- Spring Web MVC
- Spring WebSocket
- Spring Security
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL 8.4
- Flyway
- Bean Validation
- Lombok
- Docker Compose for local MySQL development

Do not replace or introduce competing technologies without explicit approval.

Examples requiring approval:

- MyBatis
- QueryDSL
- jOOQ
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Kafka
- MapStruct
- additional security/authentication libraries
- new cloud SDKs
- alternative migration tools

Use existing dependencies whenever they are sufficient.

---

## 4. Agent Change Authority

### Allowed without additional approval

The agent may:

- modify implementation code within the existing architecture
- create or modify controllers, services, repositories, DTOs, entities, mappers, and tests
- fix bugs without changing established business rules
- refactor code while preserving observable behavior
- improve naming, readability, null handling, and duplication
- add or update tests for existing behavior
- update comments or documentation related to the requested change

### Explicit developer approval required

The agent must stop and request approval before:

- adding, removing, or upgrading dependencies
- creating, deleting, or modifying a Flyway migration
- changing the database schema
- changing a public API contract
- changing authentication or authorization architecture
- changing package/module architecture
- changing established business rules
- changing persistence strategy
- changing transaction boundaries in a way that affects behavior
- introducing a new infrastructure component
- making broad refactors unrelated to the requested task

When approval is required, explain:

- why the change is necessary
- what files or components would change
- expected impact
- safer alternatives, if any

Do not implement the restricted change until approval is given.

---

## 5. Architecture Rules

Use the existing layered structure unless the repository already defines a more specific convention.

Default request flow:

`Controller -> Service -> Repository -> Database`

### Controller

- Handle HTTP request/response concerns.
- Validate incoming request DTOs.
- Delegate business logic to services.
- Do not contain persistence logic.
- Do not contain significant business logic.

### Service

- Own application and business logic.
- Define transactional boundaries where appropriate.
- Coordinate repositories and external integrations.
- Enforce business rules.

### Repository

- Own persistence access.
- Keep query logic focused on data access.
- Do not place HTTP or presentation concerns here.

### DTO

- Use request/response DTOs for API boundaries.
- Do not expose JPA entities directly as API responses.
- Keep API models separate from persistence models.

### Entity

- Model persistence state and database relationships.
- Keep database-generated columns read-only when appropriate.
- Do not make entities responsible for HTTP concerns.

Follow existing package and naming conventions before creating new structures.

---

## 6. Database, JPA, and Flyway Rules

Flyway owns schema evolution.

Hibernate/JPA maps and validates the schema; it does not own schema creation or migration.

Required policy:

```yaml
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
```

Never change this to `update`, `create`, or `create-drop` unless the developer explicitly instructs otherwise.

### Migration rules

- Never modify a migration that has already been shared or applied.
- Every schema change must use a new Flyway migration.
- Never treat manual changes in MySQL Workbench or a local DB console as the final solution.
- Never silently change schema from application code.
- Do not reuse an already published Flyway version number.
- Check existing migrations before proposing a new version.
- Schema changes require explicit developer approval.

### Entity mapping rules

- Match column names and data types deliberately.
- Preserve nullable/non-nullable semantics.
- Preserve unique constraints and relationship semantics.
- Treat generated columns as database-owned values.
- Use `insertable = false, updatable = false` when the database owns the value.
- Do not weaken database constraints to simplify Java code.

If the Entity and database design disagree, report the mismatch instead of silently changing either side.

---

## 7. API, DTO, and Validation Rules

- Validate external input at the API boundary using Bean Validation where appropriate.
- Use request DTOs and response DTOs.
- Do not return entities directly.
- Do not silently change field names, response shapes, status codes, or endpoint paths.
- Public API contract changes require developer approval.
- Keep validation rules consistent with confirmed service rules and database constraints.
- Do not invent undocumented business rules.

When requirements are missing or contradictory, ask before implementing.

---

## 8. Transaction and Persistence Rules

- Place transaction boundaries primarily in the service layer.
- Use `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` for read-only service operations when appropriate.
- Use write transactions only where state changes occur.
- Avoid unnecessary long-running transactions.
- Do not call external network services inside a transaction unless the existing design explicitly requires it.
- Preserve atomicity for operations that must succeed or fail together.

Do not change transaction behavior merely for convenience.

---

## 9. Error Handling Rules

- Follow the repository's existing exception-handling pattern.
- Do not expose stack traces, SQL errors, credentials, or internal implementation details through API responses.
- Use domain/application exceptions when the project has an established convention.
- Keep error codes/messages consistent with existing API conventions.
- Do not invent new global error formats without approval.

---

## 10. Security and Secrets

Never commit or hard-code:

- passwords
- API keys
- access tokens
- refresh tokens
- cloud credentials
- private keys
- production connection strings

Use environment variables or the project's approved configuration mechanism.

Do not weaken authentication, authorization, password hashing, token handling, or ownership checks without explicit approval.

---

## 11. Dependency Rules

Before proposing a dependency:

1. Check whether the existing JDK, Spring Boot, or current dependencies already solve the problem.
2. Prefer the standard library or existing framework capability.
3. Explain why a new dependency is necessary.
4. Request developer approval.

Do not add a dependency solely to reduce a small amount of code.

---

## 12. Testing and Verification

A task is not complete merely because code was written.

Run the smallest relevant verification first, then broader checks when appropriate.

Default:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

For build-affecting or cross-cutting changes:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

For database-related verification, when applicable:

```bash
docker compose up -d
./gradlew test
```

Testing expectations:

- add or update tests when behavior changes
- preserve existing tests
- do not delete failing tests just to make the build green
- investigate failures before changing assertions
- report tests that could not be run and the reason

Never claim a test or build passed unless it was actually run successfully.

---

## 13. Scope Control

Only change what is necessary for the requested task.

Do not:

- perform unrelated refactors
- rename unrelated packages/classes
- reformat the entire repository
- change database naming conventions without need
- restructure modules for personal preference
- rewrite working code without a clear task-related reason

When you discover an unrelated issue, report it separately instead of fixing it automatically.

---

## 14. Prohibited Actions

The agent must not:

- modify already-applied/shared Flyway migrations
- use Hibernate schema auto-update as a migration mechanism
- make manual DB changes the source of truth
- add dependencies without approval
- change API contracts without approval
- change established business rules without approval
- expose entities directly through public APIs
- commit secrets
- bypass validation or authorization for convenience
- suppress errors without understanding the cause
- claim verification that was not performed

---

## 15. Definition of Done

A task is complete only when:

- the requested behavior is implemented
- the change follows `RULE.md` and this file
- the existing architecture is respected
- relevant tests are added or updated when appropriate
- relevant tests pass
- the build passes when applicable
- no unauthorized dependency, schema, API, or business-rule change was introduced
- no unrelated files were changed unnecessarily
- unverified items and remaining risks are clearly reported

---

## 16. Completion Report

When finishing a task, report concisely:

1. What changed
2. Files changed
3. Tests / verification performed
4. Tests not run, if any, and why
5. Database/API/dependency changes, if any
6. Remaining risks or follow-up work

Example:

```text
Changes
- Implemented user profile lookup.
- Added UserProfileResponse DTO.

Files
- UserController.java
- UserService.java
- UserProfileResponse.java

Verification
- ./gradlew test: passed

DB/API/Dependencies
- No schema changes.
- No dependency changes.

Remaining
- None.
```

---

## 17. General Decision Rule

Prefer the smallest correct change that fits the existing design.

When uncertain:

- inspect before editing
- preserve existing behavior
- avoid guessing
- ask before making irreversible or cross-cutting changes
